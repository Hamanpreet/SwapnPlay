## :rocket: Deployment

Our app is live! Please click the link to check it out [SwapnPlay](https://swapnplay.netlify.app/).
SwapnPlay is successfully deployed on `Netlify` leveraging its robust hosting capabilities. This involved configuring deployment settings, managing environment variables, and implementing continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline the development workflow. On the backend, we utilized `Render` as the hosting platform, harnessing its container-based architecture to deploy and manage microservices seamlessly and for data management, I integrated `ElephantSQL` as the relational database provider.

## :gem: Idea & Energy Behind SwapnPlay
We are excited to introduce you to `SwapnPlay`.

_We live in a world of consumerism and over buying stuff! Our homes and our minds are stressed over decluttering and finding more space. As responsible parents, we want to teach our kids about simple joys of life, to be more mindful of their spending, learn to share and let go and to experience the feeling that the same toy that is eating dust somewhere in a closet is capable of bringing so much excitement to another child!
So, this app is our way to step in the right direction. 
Because its free, it brings happiness, and its environmentally friendly!_

## :books: Tech Stack
**SwapnPLay** is a _full-stack application_ which uses `PERN` stack. `PostgreSQL` as relational database system,  `Node.js` & `Express.js` at backend and `React.js` frameworks for front end. Front-end has been build using `Material UI`.

  </a>
</p>

In addition to PERN stack we have also utilized following technoligies to enhance the functinlaity of SwapnPlay. We have used `Cloudinary API` for images uploading, `OpenAI` to generate enhanced toy descriptions, `Auth0` for seamless login/logout, `Swagger` for API documentation and `Socket.IO` for Chat feature.
